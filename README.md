# PhySim Class repro
This repro contains all the code and the reports for the class. 

## Workflow with git
We have a main branch were all the submitted exercise are in. For every new Exercise there 
is a new branch called ex1 for exercise one. Everyone creates his own subbranch and from ex1
for example ex1/ax. All work is done on your local branch. If you think you impl a feature 
or solved a task. Create a pull request (ex1/ax => ex1) in gitlab. The other group members 
will review the changes and make comments, reject or approve the the request. If it gets 
approved merge the Pr into the ex1 branch. If the exercise is submit merge the ex1 branch into
the master branch.
